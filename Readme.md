##**Cancer type prediction using Machine Learning algorithms**

* The main goal of this project is the phenotype determination (=cancer type) using gene expression levels of
a variety of genes of interest) in the most occurring cancer types.
* The programming language used is python.
* The machine  learning library is Tensorlflow 


* This project uses python3.9.0, if your python version is not updated please write the following command in your terminal.

```{}
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
python3 -V
```
### Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### place yourself to the location of the code
``` bash
cd location of main.py and data files
```

## Five ML models were compared:
1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
2. Naive Bayes (NB)
3. Multiclass logistic regression (MLR)
4. Support vector machines (SVM)
5. Random Forest (RF)

## Different regularization srategies were also applied in order to face overfitting
